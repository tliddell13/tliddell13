Hello, 
I am Tyler Liddell. I am a third year computer science student at City University of London. I am currently an aspiring full stack developer, but am
also still trying to find out where my interests lie. I am always trying to find something to learn and develop my skills as a developer. I am currently 
working on an introduction to AI with Python course off of edX and will be posting my projects here. 
I also like to post my university projects and whatever other projects I decide to do on the side.

I am currently looking for remote work and have right to work full-time in the US, and part-time in the UK.
Send me an email at tliddell13@gmail.com to get in touch.
